## Overview

This guide describes the procedures for evaluating homework submissions in the Operating Systems course. The homework component accounts for **25%** of the final grade.

---

## 1. Submission Requirements

### 1.1 File Format

All homework must be submitted as **asciinema recordings** (`.cast` files) generated using the official recording scripts:

```bash
# Python TUI version
python3 record_homework_tui_EN.py

# Bash version
./record_homework_EN.sh
```

### 1.2 Required Metadata

Each `.cast` file must contain a JSON header with:

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "width": 120,
    "height": 30,
    "timestamp": 1706612345,
    "student_id": "123456",
    "student_name": "Ion Popescu",
    "student_group": "1234A",
    "seminar": "SEM02",
    "homework_id": "S02b_Control_Operators"
}
```

### 1.3 Cryptographic Signature

Each submission must include a valid cryptographic signature appended as the last line:

```
# SIGNATURE: <base64_encoded_signature>
```

The signature is generated by:
1. Hashing all content (excluding signature line) with SHA-256
2. Signing the hash with the student's private key
3. Base64 encoding the signature

## 5. Verification Procedures

### 5.1 Automated Checks

The `verify_homework_EN.sh` script performs:

1. **Signature verification**
   - Extract signature from file
   - Verify against public key
   - Flag invalid/missing signatures

2. **Metadata validation**
   - Check required fields present
   - Validate student ID format
   - Verify seminar/homework ID

3. **Timestamp verification**
   - Compare against deadlines
   - Calculate late penalties

### 5.2 Manual Review Triggers

Manual review is required when:
- Signature verification fails
- Unusually short recording (< 2 minutes)
- Unusually long recording (> 60 minutes)
- Identical content to another submission
- Student requests re-evaluation

### 5.3 Plagiarism Detection

Signs of potential plagiarism:
- Identical command sequences
- Same typos/mistakes
- Copied error messages
- Timestamp anomalies

Actions:
1. Flag both submissions
2. Interview students separately
3. Refer to course coordinator if confirmed

---

## 6. Grading Workflow

### 6.1 Pre-Grading

```bash
# 1. Collect submissions
./collect_submissions.sh /server/homeworks/ ./local_submissions/

# 2. Verify signatures
./verify_homework_EN.sh -r ./local_submissions/

# 3. Review verification report
cat ./verification_results/verification_report.md
```

### 6.2 Grading

```bash
# 1. Run automated grading
python3 grade_homework_EN.py \
    -s ./local_submissions/ \
    -r ./homework_rubrics/ \
    -d ./deadlines.csv \
    -o homework_grades.csv

# 2. Review flagged submissions manually
# 3. Update grades as needed
```

### 6.3 Post-Grading

```bash
# 1. Generate final report
python3 generate_homework_report.py \
    -i homework_grades.csv \
    -o homework_report.pdf

# 2. Identify elimination cases
grep "ELIMINATION" homework_grades.csv > eliminations.csv

# 3. Notify affected students
```
