# S07 Instructor Guide — Final Evaluation Session

## Pre-Evaluation Preparation

### One Week Before

- [ ] Verify all homework submissions collected
- [ ] Run plagiarism detection on submissions
- [ ] Prepare oral verification questions
- [ ] Set up evaluation environment
- [ ] Distribute project presentation schedule

### Day Before

- [ ] Test autograder on sample submissions
- [ ] Prepare backup evaluation materials
- [ ] Review edge cases from previous years
- [ ] Confirm room and equipment

## Evaluation Day Timeline

### Project Presentations (if applicable)

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0:00-0:10 | Setup, attendance | Verify identity |
| 0:10-0:25 | Student 1 presentation (10 min) + Q&A (5 min) | Use oral defence questions |
| 0:25-0:40 | Student 2 presentation + Q&A | |
| ... | Continue pattern | 15 min per student |

### Written Test (if applicable)

| Time | Activity |

| 0:05-0:50 | Test time (45 min) |
| 0:50-0:55 | Collection, verification |

## Oral Verification Protocol

### Purpose
Verify that students understand their own submissions and did not use AI/plagiarism.

### Procedure

1. **Select 2-3 questions** from oral_defence_questions_EN.md
2. **Ask about specific code** from their submission:
   - "Walk me through this function"
   - "Why did you use this approach?"
   - "What happens if this input is invalid?"
3. **Assess understanding**, not memorisation
4. **Document responses** in evaluation log

### Red Flags

- Cannot explain own code
- Uses terminology inconsistent with code style
- Cannot modify code when asked
- Suspiciously uniform submissions

## Grading Workflow

```
1. Automated grading (autograder) → Base score
2. Manual review (edge cases) → Adjustments
3. Oral verification → Authenticity check
4. Final grade calculation → GRADING_POLICY.md formula
5. Grade entry → University system
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Student claims autograder bug | Review manually, document |
| Suspected plagiarism | Oral verification, compare with MOSS |
| Technical failure during demo | Allow retry, document circumstances |
| Grade dispute | Refer to rubric, explain scoring |

## Post-Evaluation

- [ ] Enter grades in system
- [ ] Archive submissions
- [ ] Document any issues for next year
- [ ] Collect student feedback (optional)
