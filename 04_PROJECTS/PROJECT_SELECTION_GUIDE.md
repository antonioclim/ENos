## Detailed Selection Matrix

### By Your Situation

| Your Situation | Recommended Projects | Why |
|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| First time with Linux/Bash | E01, E03 | Focus on basic commands (`find`, `mv`) |
| Know Python, learning Bash | E02, E04 | Familiar patterns, text processing |
| Comfortable with scripting | M01, M03, M12 | Practical, real-world tools |
| Interested in security | M04, M07 | Industry-relevant skills |
| Interested in DevOps | M05, M09 | Deployment and automation |
| Systems programming enthusiast | A01, A02 | Deep OS concepts, C integration |
| Limited time (<20h available) | E01-E05 only | Be realistic about scope |
| Want maximum challenge | A01 + K8s bonus | Full experience, impressive CV |

## 🏆 My Personal Recommendations

Based on grading hundreds of submissions, here are my honest opinions:

### Best "Bang for Buck"
**M01 (Incremental Backup System)**

Why: Clear requirements, practical output, you will actually use it. Most students who choose this finish on time and learn a lot about `tar`, `find` and scheduling.

### Most Interesting to Implement
**M02 (Process Lifecycle Monitor)**

Why: You will spend hours exploring `/proc` and understanding how Linux actually tracks processes. Students who choose this often say "I finally understand what `ps` actually does."

### Easiest to Test and Debug
**E01 (File System Auditor)**

Why: Deterministic outputs. You create test directories, run your script, check the output. No timing issues, no network problems, no race conditions.

### Hardest to Debug (Fair Warning)
**A03 (Distributed File Sync)**

Why: Network issues are notoriously hard to reproduce. "It works on my machine" is guaranteed. Only choose this if you enjoy pain. (I say this with love — it is also the most impressive on a CV.)

### Hidden Gem
**M14 (Environment Config Manager)**

Why: Underrated project. You learn about dotfiles, templating and configuration management — skills every developer needs but few courses teach.

## ⚠️ Red Flags — When to Reconsider

### Do NOT Choose ADVANCED If...

- ❌ You have not compiled C code in the last 6 months
- ❌ You do not know what `malloc()` and `free()` do
- ❌ You have less than 40 hours to dedicate
- ❌ You are uncomfortable with segmentation faults

> **True story:** In 2023, a student chose A01 because "it looked cool." They spent 30 hours just understanding shared memory before writing any actual scheduler logic. They finished, but barely slept for two weeks.

### Do NOT Choose MEDIUM with K8s Bonus If...

- ❌ You have never used Docker
- ❌ You have never written a YAML file
- ❌ You have less than 35 hours available

The K8s bonus is +10%, but the learning curve can add 10+ hours.

### Do NOT Choose Based On...

- ❌ "It sounds impressive" — impress with quality, not complexity
- ❌ "My friend chose it" — your friend has different skills
- ❌ "I want to learn X" — learning during the project is fine, but not from zero

---

## ✅ Green Flags — Good Reasons to Choose

- ✅ "I actually need this tool" — motivation is everything
- ✅ "I have done something similar before" — builds on existing knowledge
- ✅ "The requirements are clear to me" — you understand what success looks like
- ✅ "I have buffer time if things go wrong" — realistic planning

## Project Difficulty Calibration

Here is how I would rank the projects by actual difficulty (not official levels):

### Easier Than They Look
- E01 File System Auditor (very straightforward)
- E03 Bulk File Organiser (mostly `find` and `mv`)
- M09 Scheduled Tasks Manager (cron is well-documented)

### Harder Than They Look
- M02 Process Lifecycle Monitor (parsing `/proc` is tricky)
- M04 Network Security Scanner (networking edge cases)
- A02 Interactive Shell Extension (terminal handling is arcane)

### Exactly As Difficult As Expected
- M01 Incremental Backup (solid medium challenge)
- M12 File Integrity Monitor (clear scope)
- A01 Mini Job Scheduler (challenging but well-defined)

## Final Advice

1. **Read the full specification** before deciding — not just the title
2. **Check the "Implementation Hints"** section — does it make sense to you?
3. **Look at the "Evaluation Criteria"** — can you satisfy at least 70%?
4. **Ask yourself:** "If I get stuck, can I Google my way out?" (For ADVANCED: often no)

When in doubt, choose one level below what you think you can handle. A well-executed EASY project scores better than a rushed MEDIUM project.

*Good luck choosing! And remember — the best project is the one you finish.*
