## ⚠️ Academic Integrity Declaration (MANDATORY)

Include this **at the top of EVERY script** you submit:

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY DECLARATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# I, [YOUR FULL NAME], declare that:
# 1. This code is my own work
# 2. I have not copied from colleagues or online sources
# 3. Any AI assistance used is documented below:
#    - Tool used: [None / ChatGPT / Claude / Copilot / Other]
#    - Prompts used: [Describe or "None"]
#    - What I modified and why: [Explain or "N/A"]
# 4. I can explain every line of this code verbally
#
# Student ID: [YOUR ID]
# Date: [SUBMISSION DATE]
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Missing declaration = automatic 10% penalty**

## 🎤 Oral Defence Requirement (20% of grade)

You **must** attend a scheduled oral defence session where you will:

1. **Explain your code** — walk through a function of the instructor's choosing
2. **Modify your code live** — implement a small change on the spot
3. **Discuss edge cases** — explain what happens in unusual scenarios

*This portion cannot be delegated to AI. See `S05_04_ORAL_DEFENCE_GUIDE.md` for full details.*

> 💡 **Pro tip from past students:** Practice explaining your code out loud before the viva. If you can't explain it to your rubber duck, you can't explain it to me.

## Requirements

### R1: Log Analyser (40%)

**Script:** `log_analyzer.sh`

Create a log file analyser that processes files in this format:
```
[2025-01-15 10:00:00] [INFO] Application started
[2025-01-15 10:00:05] [ERROR] Connection failed
```

#### Mandatory Features

| Feature | Points | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Argument parsing | 8 | `-h`, `-v`, `-l LEVEL`, `-o FILE`, `--top N` |
| Log line parsing | 8 | Extract timestamp, level, message using regex |
| Level statistics | 8 | Count entries per level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG) |
| Top messages | 8 | Show N most frequent messages |
| Report generation | 8 | Formatted output with totals and percentages |

#### Expected Output Example

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    LOG ANALYSIS REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

File:        server.log
Total lines: 12

Level Distribution:
  INFO:   6 (50.0%)  ████████████████████
  WARN:   2 (16.7%)  ██████
  ERROR:  2 (16.7%)  ██████
  DEBUG:  2 (16.7%)  ██████

Top 3 Messages:
  1. "Application started" (2 occurrences)
  2. "Connection refused" (2 occurrences)
  3. "Config loaded" (1 occurrence)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

#### Technical Requirements

- Must use `declare -A LEVEL_COUNT` for counting
- Must use `declare -A MESSAGE_COUNT` for message frequency
- Functions: `parse_line()`, `count_levels()`, `get_top_messages()`, `print_report()`
- All functions must use `local` for variables
- Must have `set -euo pipefail` and `trap EXIT`

---

### R2: Config Manager (30%)

**Script:** `config_manager.sh`

Create a configuration file manager that handles `key=value` files.

#### Commands to Implement

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `get` | `./config_manager.sh get HOST` | Print value of key |
| `set` | `./config_manager.sh set PORT 9090` | Set/update a key |
| `delete` | `./config_manager.sh delete DEBUG` | Remove a key |
| `list` | `./config_manager.sh list` | Show all key=value pairs |
| `validate` | `./config_manager.sh validate` | Check required keys exist |
| `export` | `./config_manager.sh export` | Output as `export KEY=value` |

#### Expected Behaviour

```bash
$ ./config_manager.sh list
HOST=localhost
PORT=8080

$ ./config_manager.sh get PORT
8080

$ ./config_manager.sh set PORT 9090
Updated: PORT=9090

$ ./config_manager.sh validate
✓ HOST: localhost
✓ PORT: 9090
✗ DB_HOST: missing (required)
Validation failed: 1 missing key(s)
```

#### Technical Requirements

- Must use `declare -A CONFIG` for storage
- Must ignore comments (`#`) and empty lines
- Must handle `key=value` and `key = value` (spaces around `=`)
- Functions: `load_config()`, `save_config()`, `get_value()`, `set_value()`

---

### R3: Script Refactoring (30%)

**Script:** `refactored_script.sh`

You are given a broken script with **10 intentional problems**. Fix all of them.

#### Problems to Fix

| # | Problem | Hint |
|---|---------|------|
| 1 | Missing strict mode | Add `set -euo pipefail` |
| 2 | `$*` instead of `"$@"` | Preserves arguments with spaces |
| 3 | Unquoted array expansion | `${arr[@]}` → `"${arr[@]}"` |
| 4 | Global variables in functions | Add `local` keyword |
| 5 | Unquoted variable | `$var` → `"$var"` |
| 6 | UUOC (Useless Use of Cat) | `cat file \| cmd` → `cmd < file` |
| 7 | Missing `declare -A` | Required for associative arrays |
| 8 | Missing input validation | Check arguments exist |
| 9 | Missing usage function | Add `--help` support |
| 10 | Missing cleanup trap | Add `trap cleanup EXIT` |

#### Submission Format

For each fix, add a comment explaining:
```bash
# FIX #3: Added quotes around array expansion
# BEFORE: for f in ${files[@]}
# AFTER:  for f in "${files[@]}"
# WHY:    Without quotes, elements with spaces are split
for f in "${files[@]}"; do
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT?**
> Yes, but you must (1) document exactly what you used, (2) explain what you modified and (3) be able to explain every line in the oral defence. Submitting AI output verbatim without understanding it will be obvious during the viva.

**Q: What if shellcheck gives warnings I don't understand?**
> Google the SC code (e.g., "SC2086 shellcheck"). The wiki explains every warning. If still stuck, ask in the course forum — but show you tried first.

**Q: How strict is the output format?**
> The exact formatting doesn't need to match the examples pixel-perfect. What matters is that all required information is present and readable.

### Technical

**Q: My regex works in regex101.com but not in Bash?**
> Bash uses POSIX extended regex, not PCRE. Common gotchas: no `\d` (use `[0-9]`), no `+?` (use `+` or `{1,}`), must use `=~` operator.

**Q: How do I iterate over an associative array?**
> ```bash
> for key in "${!CONFIG[@]}"; do
>     echo "$key = ${CONFIG[$key]}"
> done
> ```

**Q: What's the difference between `${arr[@]}` and `${arr[*]}`?**
> With quotes: `"${arr[@]}"` preserves element boundaries, `"${arr[*]}"` joins into one string. Always use `"${arr[@]}"` in `for` loops.

**Q: How do I make `set -e` not exit on grep finding nothing?**
> `grep "pattern" file || true` — the `|| true` prevents the non-zero exit from triggering errexit.

### Submission

**Q: Do I need to include the test files?**
> Yes! Include `test_files/` with your sample data. We need to be able to run your scripts.

**Q: What if my partner submitted something similar?**
> Each submission must be individual work. Similar structure is expected (we gave you templates), but the implementation details should differ.

## 🚫 Common Mistakes from Previous Years

*These are real mistakes from 2023-2024 submissions — learn from them!*

| Mistake | Frequency | How to Avoid |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Missing `declare -A` for hash | 67% | **Always** declare before using `arr[string_key]` |
| Unquoted `${arr[@]}` in loops | 58% | Muscle memory: always type the quotes |
| Global variables in functions | 52% | Start every function with `local` declarations |
| No argument validation | 45% | First thing in `main()`: check `$#` |
| `cat file \| grep` pattern | 41% | Use `grep pattern file` or `grep pattern < file` |
| Missing cleanup trap | 38% | Add `trap cleanup EXIT` right after `set -euo` |
| `$*` instead of `"$@"` | 31% | Only use `$*` if you specifically want joined string |
| Hardcoded paths | 28% | Use variables: `CONFIG_FILE="${1:-default.conf}"` |
| No `--help` option | 25% | Every script should have `-h\|--help` |
| Romanian variable names | 23% | Keep it professional: English only |

> *The `declare -A` one still haunts me. Every year, at least half the class forgets it, and their "associative array" silently becomes an indexed array with weird numeric keys.*
