  - id: q01
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "What are the two fundamental roles of an operating system?"
    options:
      - "Compiler and debugger"
      - "Extended machine (abstraction) and resource manager (allocation)"
      - "Browser and file manager"
      - "Database and web server"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The OS abstracts hardware complexity (extended machine) and manages shared resources fairly (resource manager)."

  - id: q02
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "Which of the following is a monolithic kernel operating system?"
    options:
      - "Minix"
      - "QNX"
      - "Linux"
      - "seL4"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Linux uses a monolithic architecture where all kernel services run in the same address space."

  - id: q03
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "In what year was UNIX created?"
    options:
      - "1956"
      - "1969"
      - "1981"
      - "1991"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "UNIX was created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs."

  - id: q04
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "What are the five core functions of an operating system?"
    options:
      - "Compile, link, load, execute, terminate"
      - "Process, memory, file, I/O, and security management"
      - "Input, processing, output, storage, feedback"
      - "Create, read, update, delete, search"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The OS manages processes, memory, files, I/O devices and enforces security policies."

  - id: q05
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "Why can't user applications access hardware directly in modern operating systems?"
    options:
      - "Hardware is too slow"
      - "Applications would interfere with each other and could crash the system"
      - "It would be too easy for users"
      - "Hardware doesn't support direct access"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Direct access would allow one application to corrupt another's data or crash the entire system. The OS provides protected abstractions."

  - id: q06
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What is the main advantage of a microkernel architecture over a monolithic kernel?"
    options:
      - "Higher performance"
      - "Fault isolation — a bug in one component doesn't crash the whole system"
      - "Smaller memory footprint"
      - "Easier to programme"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Microkernels run services in user space; if the file server crashes, the rest of the system continues."

  - id: q07
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "Why did batch processing dramatically increase CPU utilisation in the 1950s?"
    options:
      - "CPUs became faster"
      - "It eliminated idle time between jobs by automating job sequencing"
      - "Memory increased"
      - "Programmers became more efficient"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Before batch processing, the CPU sat idle while operators manually loaded the next job. Automation eliminated this delay."

  - id: q08
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What is the difference between kernel space and user space?"
    options:
      - "Kernel space is on disk, user space is in memory"
      - "Kernel space has unrestricted hardware access; user space has protected, limited access"
      - "Kernel space is for the administrator, user space is for regular users"
      - "There is no practical difference"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Kernel space runs in privileged CPU mode with full hardware access; user space is restricted for safety."

  - id: q09
    bloom: analyse
    difficulty: hard
    text: "Why might Linux (monolithic) dominate the server market despite microkernel's theoretical advantages?"
    options:
      - "Linux is free"
      - "Performance: monolithic kernels avoid inter-process communication overhead"
      - "Microkernel patents"
      - "Linux has better documentation"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Monolithic kernels use direct function calls instead of IPC, reducing latency — critical for high-performance servers."

    difficulty: hard
    text: "Comparing 1950s batch processing to modern CI/CD pipelines, what fundamental problem do both solve?"
    options:
      - "Code compilation"
      - "Maximising resource utilisation by automating sequential task execution"
      - "User interface design"
      - "Network communication"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Both batch processing and CI/CD pipelines automate task sequencing to keep compute resources busy without human intervention."

    text: "You run 'ps aux | wc -l' and see 247 processes. The system has 8 CPU cores. How is this possible?"
    options:
      - "The command is broken"
      - "The OS uses time-sharing: processes take turns on the CPU"
      - "Each process uses 1/247th of a core"
      - "247 is the maximum allowed"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Time-sharing (scheduling) allows many more processes than cores by rapidly switching between them."

    bloom: apply
    difficulty: hard
    text: "For a safety-critical pacemaker, would you choose a monolithic or microkernel architecture?"
    options:
      - "Monolithic, for maximum performance"
      - "Microkernel, for fault isolation and formal verification potential"
      - "Hybrid, for balance"
      - "No OS is needed"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Medical devices benefit from fault isolation and the ability to formally verify a small kernel (e.g., seL4)."
