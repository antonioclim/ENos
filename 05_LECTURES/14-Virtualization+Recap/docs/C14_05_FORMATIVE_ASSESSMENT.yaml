    difficulty: easy
    text: "What is a hypervisor (VMM - Virtual Machine Monitor)?"
    options:
      - "A type of processor"
      - "Software that creates and manages virtual machines, providing hardware abstraction"
      - "A network protocol"
      - "A type of memorie"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Hypervisor = layer that allows running multiple OSes on the same physical hardware."

    difficulty: easy
    text: "What is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors?"
    options:
      - "There is no difference"
      - "Type 1 (bare-metal): runs directly on hardware. Type 2 (hosted): runs on top of a host OS"
      - "Type 2 is faster"
      - "Type 1 is software, Type 2 is hardware"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Type 1: VMware ESXi, Xen (performance). Type 2: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation (convenience)."

    difficulty: easy
    text: "What does paravirtualisation mean?"
    options:
      - "Very fast virtualisation"
      - "The guest OS is modified to know it runs virtualised and communicates directly with the hypervisor"
      - "Network-only virtualisation"
      - "Hardware virtualisation"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Paravirtualisation: modified guest OS uses hypercalls instead of privileged instructions."

  - id: q04
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "How do Intel VT-x/AMD-V help with virtualisation?"
    options:
      - "They increase CPU speed"
      - "They add a new ring (ring -1) for the hypervisor, enabling efficient traps"
      - "They encrypt data"
      - "They manage memorie"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Hardware virtualisation: hypervisor in VMX root mode, guest in VMX non-root. Efficient VM exits."

    difficulty: medium
    text: "What is a shadow tabel de pagini and why is it necessary?"
    options:
      - "A backup copy"
      - "The hypervisor maintains guest-virtual → host-physical translation for performance"
      - "A type of encryption"
      - "It is not necessary"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Guest has its own PT (guest VA→guest PA). Shadow PT: guest VA→host PA, for hardware MMU."

  - id: q06
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What advantage does EPT/NPT (Extended Page Tables) offer?"
    options:
      - "More memorie"
      - "Hardware manages guest→host address translation, eliminating shadow PT"
      - "Improved security"
      - "It offers no advantages"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "EPT/NPT: hardware MMU performs two translations (guest VA→guest PA→host PA), without software overhead."

    difficulty: medium
    text: "Why are containers more lightweight than VMs?"
    options:
      - "They are not more lightweight"
      - "Containers share the host kernel; VMs each have their own kernel and OS"
      - "Containers have no isolation"
      - "VMs are older"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Container: isolated procese (namespaces, cgroups), without full OS overhead."

  - id: q08
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What Linux mechanisms do containers use for isolation?"
    options:
      - "Hardware virtualisation"
      - "Namespaces (resource isolation) and cgroups (resource limits)"
      - "Shadow page tables"
      - "Type 2 hypervisor"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Namespaces: isolate PID, network, mount, etc. Cgroups: limit CPU, memorie, I/O."

    text: "When is full virtualisation preferred over containers?"
    options:
      - "Always"
      - "When you need to run different OSes or require maximum isolation (security boundaries)"
      - "When you want maximum performance"
      - "Never"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "VM: kernel-level isolation, different OSes. Container: same kernel, weaker but efficient isolation."

    bloom: analyse
    difficulty: hard
    text: "What is the main overhead of full virtualisation without hardware support?"
    options:
      - "There is no overhead"
      - "Trap-and-emulate for privileged instructions: each trap is costly"
      - "Network consumption"
      - "Disk space"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Without VT-x: trap on each privileged instruction, hypervisor emulates. With VT-x: fast exit."

    text: "Why is live migration (moving a VM without downtime) possible?"
    options:
      - "It is not possible"
      - "Memory is copied incrementally while the VM runs, then a short freeze for final state"
      - "The VM has no state"
      - "It uses encryption"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Pre-copy: copies RAM iteratively. Short VM stop, copy remaining dirty pages, resume on new host."

    text: "You have a server with 64GB RAM and want to run 100 isolated instances of the same application. What do you choose?"
    options:
      - "100 full VMs"
      - "Containers: share kernel and libraries, overhead ~MB per instance vs ~GB per VM"
      - "100 procese without isolation"
      - "It is not possible"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Container: ~10-50MB overhead vs VM ~1GB. 100 containers in 64GB possible; 100 VMs - impossible."
