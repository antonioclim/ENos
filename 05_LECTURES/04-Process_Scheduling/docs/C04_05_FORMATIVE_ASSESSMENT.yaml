  - id: q01
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "What is a scheduler?"
    options:
      - "A code compiler"
      - "The OS component that decides which process runs on the CPU"
      - "A type of memory"
      - "A network protocol"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The scheduler selects the next process from the Ready queue for execution on the CPU."

  - id: q02
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "What does preemption mean?"
    options:
      - "Forced termination of a process"
      - "The OS can interrupt a running process to run another one"
      - "Creation of a new process"
      - "Memory allocation"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Preemption = the OS's ability to forcibly suspend a process to give the CPU to another."

  - id: q03
    bloom: remember
    difficulty: easy
    text: "What is turnaround time?"
    options:
      - "System boot time"
      - "Total time from submission to process completion"
      - "CPU execution time"
      - "Queue waiting time"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Turnaround time = total time (submission → completion), includes waiting + execution."

  - id: q04
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What is the difference between FCFS and SJF?"
    options:
      - "FCFS is preemptive, SJF is not"
      - "FCFS serves in arrival order, SJF serves the shortest job first"
      - "SJF is slower"
      - "There is no difference"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "FCFS = First Come First Served (arrival order). SJF = Shortest Job First (shortest first)."

  - id: q05
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What problem does Round Robin (RR) solve?"
    options:
      - "Minimises turnaround time"
      - "Ensures fairness through equal time quanta for all processes"
      - "Eliminates deadlocks"
      - "Reduces memory consumption"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "RR gives each process a time quantum, preventing starvation and ensuring fairness."

  - id: q06
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "What is starvation in the context of scheduling?"
    options:
      - "A process that consumes too much CPU"
      - "A process that never receives CPU because others have higher priority"
      - "Lack of RAM memory"
      - "Disk error"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Starvation = a process waits indefinitely for CPU because other processes always preempt it."

  - id: q07
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "Why does SJF have the lowest average waiting time but is not used directly?"
    options:
      - "It is too fast"
      - "We cannot know the exact CPU burst duration in advance"
      - "It consumes too much memory"
      - "It does not work on multi-core"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "SJF is theoretically optimal but requires duration prediction, which must be estimated (exponential averaging)."

  - id: q08
    bloom: understand
    difficulty: medium
    text: "How does aging work in priority scheduling?"
    options:
      - "Terminates old processes"
      - "Gradually increases the priority of waiting processes, preventing starvation"
      - "Reduces the priority of CPU-bound processes"
      - "Deletes inactive processes"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Aging = periodic increment of priority for waiting processes to prevent starvation."

    difficulty: hard
    text: "For interactive processes (text editors), which algorithm is more suitable?"
    options:
      - "FCFS - for predictability"
      - "SJF - for maximum throughput"
      - "Round Robin or MLFQ with priority for I/O-bound"
      - "Batch processing"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Interactive processes are I/O-bound and benefit from fast response; RR/MLFQ favour them."

  - id: q10
    bloom: analyse
    difficulty: hard
    text: "The time quantum in RR is 10ms. A process requires 25ms CPU. How many times will it be preempted?"
    options:
      - "1 time"
      - "2 times"
      - "3 times"
      - "Never"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Runs 10ms (preempted), 10ms (preempted), 5ms (finishes). So 2 preemptions."

  - id: q11
    bloom: analyse
    difficulty: hard
    text: "Why is MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue) considered the most versatile algorithm?"
    options:
      - "It is the simplest to implement"
      - "It combines the advantages of multiple algorithms and adapts to process behaviour"
      - "It uses the least CPU"
      - "It does not require priorities"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "MLFQ dynamically adjusts priorities: interactive processes rise, CPU-bound fall, preventing starvation."

    text: "Three processes: P1(burst=6), P2(burst=2), P3(burst=4) arrive at t=0. With SJF, what is the average waiting time?"
    options:
      - "4.0"
      - "3.33"
      - "2.67"
      - "5.0"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "SJF order: P2(2), P3(4), P1(6). Waiting: P2=0, P3=2, P1=6. Average = (0+2+6)/3 = 2.67."
