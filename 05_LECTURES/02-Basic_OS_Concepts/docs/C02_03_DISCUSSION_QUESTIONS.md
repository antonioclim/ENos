## Basic Questions

1. **Why are interrupts essential for modern operating systems?** What would happen if we only used polling?

2. **Explain the difference between an interrupt and a trap.** Give concrete examples for each.

3. **What role does the Interrupt Vector Table play?** How does the CPU know which handler to execute?

---

## Analysis Questions

4. **Polling vs interrupts trade-off**: In what situations would polling be preferable to interrupts?

5. **Why is DMA crucial for performance?** Calculate the overhead of copying 1GB of data byte-by-byte.

6. **Nested interrupts**: What problems can occur if a low-priority interrupt interrupts a high-priority one?

## Synthesis Questions

7. **Design**: You are designing an embedded system for sensors. How would you organise the interrupt priorities?

8. **Scenarios**: A network driver receives packets at 10Gbps. Why is DMA mandatory?
